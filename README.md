## AGMNC

This code is the implementation of Adaptive Graph Matching with Node Centrality. It is developed based on the open source code of the paper [Factorized Graph Matching](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2012/6/fgm.pdf) at  [here](https://github.com/zhfe99/fgm) which implementing most of the graph matching algorithms .

The specifical methods discussed in our paper include gradually assignment (GA) , probabilistic matching (PM), spectral matching (SM),  spectral matching with affine constraints (SMAC), integer projected fixed point (IPFP)  reweighted random walk (RWRW) and adptive graph matching (AGM).



## Running

1. download and upzip "agmnc.zip";
2. run addPath.m to add the subdirectories into matlab;
3. run testHouse.m, testSyn_01outlier.m, testSyn_02nosie.m and testSyn_03eden.m to have the results;
4. run house_demo.m to have the demonstration.
